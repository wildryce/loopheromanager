# loopheromanager
A tool for the game Loop Hero to plan tile placements and find efficient setups.  


This tool is designed for users to be able to draw their loop here, and pre-plan how they would like to setup any tiles that have stat modifiers associated with them, including synergy-based tiles. The tool will calculate and display any statistics as the player builds their plan to allow them to find the most efficient setup for their particular loop world.
